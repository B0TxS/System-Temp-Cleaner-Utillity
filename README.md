# System-Temp-Cleaner-Utillity

A lightweight and efficient **system cleaning tool** built with Batch and compiled to EXE.  
This utility provides a simple, menu-driven interface to remove unnecessary files from your system, including Windows `Temp`, user `%Temp%`, and `Prefetch` directories — helping improve system performance and free up disk space.

---

##  Features
- Simple **interactive menu** for quick navigation  
- **Administrator privileges** enabled by default  
- Cleans:
  - `C:\Windows\Temp`
  - `%TEMP%`
  - `C:\Windows\Prefetch`
- **Lightweight & portable** — no installation required  
- Silent file deletion (no error popups)

##  Usage
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) section.  
2. Run as Administrator (already configured in the EXE build).  
3. Select the desired option from the menu to clean system files.  

---

##  Disclaimer
This tool is intended for **basic system cleanup**.  
Deleting `Prefetch` files is optional — Windows will rebuild them automatically.  
Use at your own discretion.  

---

##  Future Plans
- Optional **silent mode** (`/silent`) for automated cleanup  
- **Log file generation** (`CleanerLog.txt`) with cleanup details  
- Support for additional cleanup targets (browser cache, recycle bin, etc.)
